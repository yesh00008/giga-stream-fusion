# Quote & Repost Feature - Implementation Guide

## üìã Overview

This feature adds Twitter/X-style retweet functionality with two options:
1. **Repost**: Simple retweet (existing functionality)
2. **Quote**: Retweet with added comment and optional image

## üé® UI Components Created

### 1. RetweetMenu Component (`src/components/RetweetMenu.tsx`)
- Dropdown menu that appears when clicking the retweet button
- Two options: "Repost" and "Quote"
- Each option has an icon, title, and description
- Styled to match the existing app theme

### 2. QuoteDialog Component (`src/components/QuoteDialog.tsx`)
- Modal dialog for creating quote posts
- Features:
  - Text input with 500 character limit
  - Optional image upload
  - Preview of the original post being quoted
  - Shows author details with verification badge
  - Image preview with remove option

### 3. Updated PostCard Component (`src/components/PostCard.tsx`)
- Replaced simple retweet button with RetweetMenu
- Integrated QuoteDialog
- Added quote posting logic with image upload
- Includes proper error handling and toast notifications

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

Run the `SETUP_QUOTES.sql` file in your Supabase SQL Editor to add:

### New Columns Added to `posts` Table:
```sql
quoted_post_id UUID      -- References the original post being quoted
quote_count INTEGER      -- Number of times this post has been quoted
```

### Features:
- **Foreign Key**: `quoted_post_id` references `posts(id)` with ON DELETE SET NULL
- **Index**: Created on `quoted_post_id` for better query performance
- **Trigger**: Auto-updates `quote_count` when quotes are created/deleted
- **RLS Policies**: Security policies for viewing quoted posts
- **View**: `posts_with_quotes` for easy querying of posts with their quoted content

## üîß How It Works

### 1. User Clicks Retweet Button
```tsx
<RetweetMenu
  isRetweeted={localRetweeted}
  retweetCount={localRetweets}
  onRepost={handleRetweetClick}  // Simple repost
  onQuote={handleQuoteClick}      // Opens quote dialog
/>
```

### 2. Quote Post Creation Flow
```typescript
handleQuotePosted = async (content: string, imageFile?: File) => {
  // 1. Upload image if provided
  const { url } = await uploadImage(imageFile, user.id);
  
  // 2. Create post with quoted_post_id reference
  await createPost({
    user_id: user.id,
    content,
    image_urls: url ? [url] : [],
    quoted_post_id: originalPostId  // Links to original post
  });
  
  // 3. Trigger automatically increments quote_count on original post
}
```

### 3. Database Trigger Magic ‚ú®
When a quote post is created:
```sql
-- Trigger automatically runs:
UPDATE posts 
SET quote_count = quote_count + 1 
WHERE id = NEW.quoted_post_id;
```

## üìä Querying Quoted Posts

### Get a post with its quoted post details:
```sql
SELECT * FROM posts_with_quotes 
WHERE id = 'your-post-id';
```

### Get all quotes of a specific post:
```sql
SELECT p.*, pr.username, pr.full_name
FROM posts p
JOIN profiles pr ON p.user_id = pr.id
WHERE p.quoted_post_id = 'original-post-id'
ORDER BY p.created_at DESC;
```

### Feed query with quoted posts:
```typescript
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('posts')
  .select(`
    *,
    profiles(*),
    quoted_post:quoted_post_id(
      id,
      content,
      image_url,
      profiles(*)
    )
  `)
  .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
```

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Go to SQL Editor
3. Copy the contents of `SETUP_QUOTES.sql`
4. Run the script
5. Verify columns were added:
   ```sql
   SELECT column_name, data_type 
   FROM information_schema.columns
   WHERE table_name = 'posts' 
     AND column_name IN ('quoted_post_id', 'quote_count');
   ```

### Step 2: Update Feed Query (Optional)
To display quoted posts in your feed, update your feed fetching logic:

```typescript
// In Home.tsx or wherever you fetch posts
const fetchPosts = async () => {
  const { data } = await supabase
    .from('posts')
    .select(`
      *,
      profiles(*),
      quoted_post:posts!quoted_post_id(
        id,
        content,
        image_url,
        created_at,
        profiles(*)
      )
    `)
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false });
    
  setPosts(data);
};
```

### Step 3: Render Quoted Posts (Optional)
Add this to your PostCard component to show quoted posts:

```tsx
{/* Show quoted post if exists */}
{post.quoted_post && (
  <div className="mt-3 border border-border rounded-lg p-3 bg-muted/30">
    <div className="flex items-center gap-2 mb-2">
      <Avatar className="w-6 h-6">
        <AvatarImage src={post.quoted_post.profiles.avatar_url} />
      </Avatar>
      <span className="text-sm font-semibold">
        {post.quoted_post.profiles.full_name}
      </span>
      <span className="text-xs text-muted-foreground">
        @{post.quoted_post.profiles.username}
      </span>
    </div>
    <p className="text-sm">{post.quoted_post.content}</p>
    {post.quoted_post.image_url && (
      <img 
        src={post.quoted_post.image_url} 
        className="mt-2 rounded-lg max-h-48 object-cover"
      />
    )}
  </div>
)}
```

## üéØ Features Implemented

‚úÖ Dropdown menu on retweet button with two options
‚úÖ Quote dialog with text input and image upload
‚úÖ Original post preview in quote dialog
‚úÖ Image upload and preview functionality
‚úÖ Character limit (500) for quote text
‚úÖ Database schema with triggers for auto-counting
‚úÖ Proper error handling and user feedback
‚úÖ Toast notifications for success/error
‚úÖ Integration with existing feed service
‚úÖ RLS policies for security
‚úÖ Optimized queries with indexes

## üîí Security Considerations

- **RLS Policies**: Quote posts respect the same visibility rules as regular posts
- **Authentication**: Must be logged in to quote posts
- **Validation**: Character limits enforced on client and should be on server
- **Image Upload**: Uses Supabase Storage with user-specific folders
- **Cascading Deletes**: If original post is deleted, `quoted_post_id` is set to NULL

## üì± User Experience Flow

1. User sees a post they want to quote
2. Clicks the retweet button (Repeat2 icon)
3. Dropdown appears with "Repost" and "Quote" options
4. Clicks "Quote"
5. Modal opens showing:
   - Text input for their thoughts
   - Option to add an image
   - Preview of the original post
6. User adds their comment (required) and/or image
7. Clicks "Quote Post"
8. Post is created with reference to original
9. Success toast appears
10. Modal closes
11. Original post's quote_count increments automatically

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Quote count not updating
**Solution**: Make sure you ran the SETUP_QUOTES.sql script which creates the trigger.

### Issue: "Failed to post quote" error
**Solution**: Check that:
- User is authenticated
- `quoted_post_id` column exists in posts table
- RLS policies allow INSERT on posts table

### Issue: Quoted post not showing in feed
**Solution**: Update your feed query to include the joined quoted post data (see Step 2 above).

### Issue: Image upload fails
**Solution**: Verify:
- Supabase Storage bucket 'posts' exists
- RLS policies allow uploads
- User has proper authentication

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add quote count display on posts
- [ ] Show "X people quoted this" indicator
- [ ] View all quotes of a post in a separate page
- [ ] Add analytics for quote engagement
- [ ] Support nested quotes (quote of a quote)
- [ ] Add quote notifications
- [ ] Rich text editor for quote content
- [ ] GIF support in quotes
- [ ] Poll support in quotes

## üìù Notes

- The `quoted_post_id` is stored in the `metadata` field of the posts table in the current implementation
- The trigger automatically handles quote count increments/decrements
- Quote posts are treated as regular posts with an additional reference
- Users can quote their own posts
- There's no limit on how many times a post can be quoted

## üí° Tips for Developers

1. **Testing**: Create a test post and try quoting it to verify everything works
2. **Monitoring**: Check Supabase logs for any database errors
3. **Performance**: The index on `quoted_post_id` helps with query performance
4. **Cleanup**: The trigger handles count updates, but you may want to add a cron job to verify counts periodically
5. **UI/UX**: Consider adding animations when the quote is posted successfully
