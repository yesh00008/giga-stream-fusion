# 📞 Call Feature - Complete Implementation Guide

## ✅ What's Been Implemented

### 1. **Instagram-Style Call UI**
- ✅ Minimalist design matching your reference images
- ✅ "Calling..." state with large avatar
- ✅ "Didn't join" screen with Close/Call again buttons
- ✅ Connected call screen with minimal controls
- ✅ Smooth animations and transitions

### 2. **Call States**
- ✅ **Calling/Ringing**: Shows when initiating or receiving a call
- ✅ **Connected**: Active call with duration timer
- ✅ **Didn't join**: Shows when call is not answered (auto-closes after 3s)
- ✅ **Ended**: Call completed successfully
- ✅ **Rejected**: Call declined by receiver

### 3. **Advanced Features**

#### ✅ Prevent Simultaneous Calls
- Users cannot call each other at the same time
- System checks if user is already in a call before allowing new calls
- Database table `user_call_status` tracks call state

#### ✅ Busy User Detection
- Shows "User is currently in another call" if trying to call someone who's busy
- Shows "You are already in a call" if you try to start a new call while in one
- Automatic rejection of incoming calls when user is already in a call

#### ✅ Auto-Reject on Busy
- If a user receives a call while already in another call, it's automatically rejected
- No notification shown to avoid disrupting the active call

#### ✅ Missed Call Detection
- Calls not answered within 60 seconds are automatically marked as "missed"
- Database trigger handles this automatically

#### ✅ Call Again Feature
- "Call again" button appears on "Didn't join" screen
- Allows quick re-dialing after missed/rejected calls

### 4. **UI Components**

#### CallModal (Updated)
```
Top Bar:
- Close (X) button - top left
- More options (⋮) - top right

Center:
- Large avatar (when video off or audio call)
- User name
- Call status/duration

Bottom Controls:
- Ringing: Close button + Phone button
- Connected: Camera | Mic | End Call | Speaker
- Video calls show small preview in top-right corner
```

#### Call Button States
- **Camera**: Toggle video on/off (video calls only)
- **Microphone**: Toggle mute/unmute
- **End Call**: Red button to hang up
- **Speaker**: Toggle speaker/earpiece

### 5. **Database Schema**

#### New Table: `user_call_status`
```sql
- user_id: Unique user identifier
- is_in_call: Boolean flag
- current_call_id: Reference to active call
- updated_at: Last update timestamp
```

#### Automatic Triggers
1. **Update Call Status**: Sets `is_in_call` when call starts/ends
2. **Mark Missed Calls**: Auto-marks unanswered calls after 60s

### 6. **Call Flow**

#### Outgoing Call
1. User clicks Phone/Video icon
2. System checks if both users are available
3. If available, creates call record with status "ringing"
4. Caller sees "Calling..." screen
5. Receiver gets notification
6. On accept: Status → "ongoing", call connects
7. On reject/timeout: Status → "rejected"/"missed"
8. Call ends: Status → "ended"

#### Incoming Call
1. Notification appears at top of screen
2. Accept button (green) or Reject button (red)
3. If already in call: Auto-reject silently
4. If available: Show incoming call notification
5. On accept: WebRTC connection established
6. On reject: Call marked as rejected

### 7. **WebRTC Features**
- ✅ Peer-to-peer audio/video
- ✅ STUN servers for NAT traversal
- ✅ ICE candidate exchange via Supabase
- ✅ Offer/Answer SDP exchange
- ✅ Real-time signaling

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy contents of `CREATE_CALLS_TABLES.sql`
3. Execute the SQL
4. Verify tables created:
   - ✅ calls
   - ✅ call_signals
   - ✅ user_call_status (NEW)

### Step 2: Test the Features

#### Test Busy State
1. Open app in 3 browsers (User A, B, C)
2. User A calls User B
3. User B accepts
4. User C tries to call User A or B
5. Should see: "User is currently in another call"

#### Test Simultaneous Call Prevention
1. User A starts calling User B
2. At the same time, User B tries to call User A
3. Only one call should go through
4. Other should see "User is currently in another call"

#### Test Auto-Reject
1. User A calls User B (call ongoing)
2. User C calls User B
3. User B doesn't see notification (auto-rejected)
4. User C sees "User is currently in another call"

#### Test Missed Calls
1. User A calls User B
2. User B doesn't answer
3. After 60 seconds: Status → "missed"
4. Screen shows "Didn't join"
5. Auto-closes after 3 seconds

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "User is in another call" even when they're not
- Check `user_call_status` table
- Run: `UPDATE user_call_status SET is_in_call = FALSE, current_call_id = NULL WHERE user_id = 'xxx';`
- This can happen if app crashes during call

### Call doesn't auto-close on "Didn't join"
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify the call status is updating in database
- The 3-second timer should trigger automatically

### Both users can call simultaneously
- Verify `user_call_status` table exists
- Check RLS policies are enabled
- Ensure triggers are created

## 🌟 Best Practices

1. **Always check call status before initiating**
   ```typescript
   const { inCall } = await isUserInCall(receiverId);
   if (inCall) {
     toast.error('User is busy');
     return;
   }
   ```

2. **Handle busy state gracefully**
   - Show clear error messages
   - Don't spam with notifications
   - Auto-reject when necessary

3. **Clean up on unmount**
   - Stop all media tracks
   - Close peer connections
   - Unsubscribe from channels

## 📊 Database Queries

### Check who's in a call
```sql
SELECT u.user_id, p.username, u.is_in_call, u.current_call_id
FROM user_call_status u
JOIN profiles p ON p.id = u.user_id
WHERE u.is_in_call = TRUE;
```

### View all active calls
```sql
SELECT * FROM calls 
WHERE status = 'ongoing';
```

### Reset all call statuses (for testing)
```sql
UPDATE user_call_status SET is_in_call = FALSE, current_call_id = NULL;
```
