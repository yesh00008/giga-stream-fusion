## ⏳ Database Setup Required

You need to run 2 SQL files in your Supabase dashboard:

### 1. Storage RLS Policy (For Image Uploads)
**File:** `STORAGE_RLS_POLICY.sql`

**What it does:** Allows authenticated users to upload images to the 'posts' bucket

**Priority:** HIGH - Without this, image uploads will fail with "violates row-level security policy"

### 2. Feed Tables & Columns (For Feed Features)
**File:** `ADD_IMAGE_URL_COLUMN.sql` or `FEED_TABLES.sql`

**What it does:** Adds the `image_url` column to posts table

**Priority:** HIGH - Without this, images won't be stored in database

---

## Quick Setup Steps

### Step 1: Fix Storage (Image Uploads)
```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# Run: STORAGE_RLS_POLICY.sql
```

### Step 2: Fix Database (Feed Features)
```bash
# Open Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
# Run: ADD_IMAGE_URL_COLUMN.sql (quick) OR FEED_TABLES.sql (complete)
```

### Step 3: Test
1. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (or `Cmd+Shift+R` on Mac)
2. Log in to your app
3. Go to Feed page
4. Try creating a post with images
5. Should work! ✅

## Troubleshooting

### "StorageApiError: new row violates row-level security policy"
👉 Run `STORAGE_RLS_POLICY.sql`

### "Could not find the 'image_url' column"
👉 Run `ADD_IMAGE_URL_COLUMN.sql`

### "Cannot read properties of undefined"
👉 Already fixed in code! Just refresh browser.

### Images upload but don't save in database
👉 Run `ADD_IMAGE_URL_COLUMN.sql` and refresh

### Feed page won't load
👉 Run `FEED_TABLES.sql` for complete schema

## What's Next?

After running the SQL files:

1. **Test image uploads** - Try uploading 1, 2, 3, and 4 images
2. **Test post creation** - Text-only posts and posts with images
3. **Test interactions** - Like, bookmark, retweet, share
4. **Test edit/delete** - Modify and remove your posts
5. **Test polls** - Create polls with 2-4 options

Everything should work smoothly! 🚀
