# ðŸš€ Quick Setup Guide for Video/Audio Calls

## Step 1: Database Setup
1. Open your **Supabase Dashboard**
2. Go to **SQL Editor**
3. Click **New Query**
4. Open the file `CREATE_CALLS_TABLES.sql` from this project
5. Copy and paste the entire SQL content
6. Click **RUN** to execute

## Step 2: Verify Installation
After running the SQL, you should see these new tables:
- âœ… `calls`
- âœ… `call_signals`

## Step 3: Test the Feature
1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open the app in **two different browsers** (or incognito mode)
3. Login as two different users
4. Open a chat conversation
5. Click the **Phone** icon (audio call) or **Video** icon (video call)

## Step 4: Grant Permissions
