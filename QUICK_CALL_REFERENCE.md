# 🎯 Quick Reference - Call Features

## ✅ Implemented Features Summary

### 1. Instagram-Style UI ✨
- **Calling Screen**: Large avatar, "Calling..." text
- **Didn't Join Screen**: Shows when call not answered, auto-closes in 3s
- **Connected Screen**: Minimal controls, duration timer
- **Video Calls**: Full-screen remote, small local preview (top-right)

### 2. Smart Call Management 🧠

#### Busy Detection
```
❌ User A in call with User B
❌ User C calls User A → "User is currently in another call"
❌ User C calls User B → "User is currently in another call"
```

#### Prevent Simultaneous Calls
```
⚠️ User A calls User B (at same time)
⚠️ User B calls User A (at same time)
✅ Only ONE call goes through
❌ Other sees "User is currently in another call"
```

#### Auto-Reject When Busy
```
✅ User A ↔️ User B (active call)
📞 User C calls User B
🔇 Auto-rejected (no notification shown to User B)
❌ User C sees "User is currently in another call"
```

## 🚨 Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: Call doesn't connect
**Fix:** Check browser console for WebRTC errors, verify STUN servers accessible

### Issue: "User busy" when they're not
**Fix:** 
```sql
UPDATE user_call_status 
SET is_in_call = FALSE, current_call_id = NULL;
```

### Issue: No video/audio
**Fix:** Check browser permissions, device not in use by other app

### Issue: Call doesn't end automatically
**Fix:** Verify database triggers are created, check call status updates

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test with 2 browsers**: Use Chrome + Incognito for testing
2. **Check console**: WebRTC logs are verbose, very helpful for debugging
3. **Network matters**: Poor connection affects quality, use good WiFi
4. **Permissions**: Grant all permissions when prompted
5. **Database**: Monitor `user_call_status` table during testing

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify database tables exist
3. Test network connectivity
4. Review `CALL_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` for detailed info
5. Check Supabase Realtime is active
