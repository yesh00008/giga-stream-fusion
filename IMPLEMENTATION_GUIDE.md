## 🐛 **DEBUGGING**

### If 406 errors persist:
```sql
-- Check if tables exist:
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Check RLS policies:
SELECT tablename, policyname FROM pg_policies WHERE schemaname = 'public';

-- Verify triggers:
SELECT trigger_name, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_schema = 'public';
```

### If messages don't show:
```sql
-- Check if realtime is enabled:
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';

-- Should include 'messages' table
```

### If reactions don't work:
```sql
-- Test reaction insert:
INSERT INTO post_reactions (post_id, user_id, reaction_type)
VALUES ('your-post-id', auth.uid(), 'like');

-- Check reaction counts:
SELECT id, reaction_counts FROM posts WHERE id = 'your-post-id';
```
